Slide is a Web App which promotes smaller buisness to college students that are near campus. It shows students the various small businesses around them that they may have been unaware of. The discounts given by shop owners specifically to college students on the app will further encourage them to explore their campus more. This in turn allows small businesses to gain more exposure, and long term customers, making it beneficial for both parties.
